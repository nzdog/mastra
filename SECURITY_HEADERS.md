# Security Headers (Helmet)

## Overview

Helmet has been integrated to automatically set security-related HTTP headers that protect against
common web vulnerabilities. These headers provide defense-in-depth protection alongside CORS, rate
limiting, and input validation.

## Installation

```bash
npm install helmet
```

## Configuration

Located in `src/server.ts:401-435`, Helmet is configured with the following security policies:

### 1. Content Security Policy (CSP)

Prevents Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks by controlling which resources can be
loaded.

```typescript
contentSecurityPolicy: {
  directives: {
    defaultSrc: ["'self'"],                    // Only load from same origin by default
    scriptSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],  // Scripts from same origin + inline
    styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],   // Styles from same origin + inline
    imgSrc: ["'self'", 'data:', 'https:'],     // Images from same origin, data URIs, HTTPS
    connectSrc: ["'self'"],                    // API calls only to same origin
    fontSrc: ["'self'"],                       // Fonts from same origin
    objectSrc: ["'none'"],                     // No plugins (Flash, etc.)
    mediaSrc: ["'self'"],                      // Media from same origin
    frameSrc: ["'none'"],                      // No iframes
  },
}
```

**Header:** `Content-Security-Policy`

**Protection:** Prevents malicious scripts from executing, blocks data exfiltration

### 2. HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)

Forces browsers to use HTTPS instead of HTTP (production only).

```typescript
hsts: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
  ? {
      maxAge: 31536000,        // 1 year
      includeSubDomains: true, // Apply to all subdomains
      preload: true,           // Submit to HSTS preload list
    }
  : false, // Disabled in development (no HTTPS locally)
```

**Header:** `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload`

**Protection:** Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks, SSL stripping

### 3. Hide X-Powered-By

Removes the `X-Powered-By: Express` header that reveals technology stack.

```typescript
hidePoweredBy: true;
```

**Protection:** Reduces attack surface by hiding technology information

### 4. Frameguard

Prevents clickjacking attacks by denying the page from being embedded in iframes.

```typescript
frameguard: {
  action: 'deny';
}
```

**Header:** `X-Frame-Options: DENY`

**Protection:** Prevents clickjacking, UI redressing attacks

### 5. No Sniff

Prevents browsers from MIME-sniffing responses away from declared content-type.

```typescript
noSniff: true;
```

**Header:** `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`

**Protection:** Prevents MIME confusion attacks

### 6. XSS Filter

Enables browser's built-in XSS protection (legacy, CSP is better).

```typescript
xssFilter: true;
```

**Header:** `X-XSS-Protection: 0` (Helmet v8+ disables this as CSP is more effective)

**Protection:** Legacy XSS protection (mostly replaced by CSP)

## Additional Headers Set by Helmet

Helmet also sets these headers automatically:

### Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy

```
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
```

Prevents cross-origin attacks by isolating browsing context.

### Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy

```
Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin
```

Prevents resources from being loaded by other origins.

### Origin-Agent-Cluster

```
Origin-Agent-Cluster: ?1
```

Isolates origin contexts for better security.

### Referrer-Policy

```
Referrer-Policy: no-referrer
```

Prevents referrer information from leaking.

### X-DNS-Prefetch-Control

```
X-DNS-Prefetch-Control: off
```

Disables DNS prefetching for privacy.

### X-Download-Options

```
X-Download-Options: noopen
```

Prevents IE from executing downloads in site context.

### X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies

```
X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies: none
```

Restricts Flash and PDF cross-domain policies.

## Testing Security Headers

### View All Headers

```bash
curl -i http://localhost:3000/health | head -20
```

Expected output includes:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self';...
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-DNS-Prefetch-Control: off
X-Download-Options: noopen
X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies: none
...
```

### Test Specific Header

```bash
curl -s -i http://localhost:3000/health | grep "X-Frame-Options"
# Expected: X-Frame-Options: DENY
```

### Test CSP Header

```bash
curl -s -i http://localhost:3000/health | grep "Content-Security-Policy"
# Expected: Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self';script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';...
```

## Security Benefits

### ✅ XSS Protection (CSP)

**Threat:** Malicious scripts injected into pages

- **Protection:** CSP restricts which scripts can execute
- **Impact:** Blocks 90%+ of XSS attacks

### ✅ Clickjacking Protection (Frameguard)

**Threat:** Malicious site embeds your page in invisible iframe

- **Protection:** X-Frame-Options: DENY prevents iframe embedding
- **Impact:** Completely blocks clickjacking attacks

### ✅ MIME Confusion Attacks (noSniff)

**Threat:** Browser interprets file as wrong type (e.g., image as JavaScript)

- **Protection:** Forces browser to respect Content-Type header
- **Impact:** Prevents MIME-based attacks

### ✅ Man-in-the-Middle (HSTS)

**Threat:** Attacker downgrades HTTPS to HTTP to intercept traffic

- **Protection:** HSTS forces HTTPS for 1 year
- **Impact:** Prevents SSL stripping attacks (production only)

### ✅ Information Disclosure

**Threat:** Attackers learn technology stack from headers

- **Protection:** Removes X-Powered-By header
- **Impact:** Reduces reconnaissance effectiveness

### ✅ Cross-Origin Attacks

**Threat:** Malicious sites access your resources or data

- **Protection:** Multiple cross-origin policies isolate your app
- **Impact:** Prevents data theft from cross-origin contexts

## Development vs Production

### Development (Local)

- **HSTS:** Disabled (no HTTPS on localhost)
- **CSP:** Allows `'unsafe-inline'` for easier development
- **All other headers:** Enabled

### Production

- **HSTS:** Enabled with 1-year max-age
- **CSP:** Same as development (adjust if needed)
- **All headers:** Fully enabled

To enable production mode:

```env
NODE_ENV=production
```

## Customization

### Relax CSP for External Resources

If you need to load resources from CDNs:

```typescript
contentSecurityPolicy: {
  directives: {
    defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
    scriptSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'", "https://cdn.example.com"],
    styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'", "https://fonts.googleapis.com"],
    fontSrc: ["'self'", "https://fonts.gstatic.com"],
    imgSrc: ["'self'", 'data:', 'https:', "https://images.example.com"],
  },
}
```

### Allow Specific Frame Embedding

If you need to allow specific sites to embed your page:

```typescript
frameguard: {
  action: 'allow-from',
  domain: 'https://trusted-partner.com'
}
```

### Disable Specific Headers

If a header causes issues:

```typescript
helmet({
  contentSecurityPolicy: false, // Disable CSP
  // ... other options
});
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Inline Scripts Blocked

**Symptom:** Frontend JavaScript doesn't execute **Cause:** CSP blocks inline scripts by default
**Solution:** Already configured with `'unsafe-inline'` for development

### Issue 2: External Resources Blocked

**Symptom:** Images/fonts from CDN don't load **Cause:** CSP restricts external resources
**Solution:** Add CDN domains to CSP directives (see Customization)

### Issue 3: HSTS Prevents HTTP Access

**Symptom:** Can't access site via HTTP after HTTPS visit **Cause:** HSTS header forces HTTPS
**Solution:** HSTS is disabled in development, only enabled in production

### Issue 4: Iframe Embedding Blocked

**Symptom:** Page won't load in iframe **Cause:** X-Frame-Options: DENY **Solution:** Intentional
security measure; change `frameguard` if needed

## Integration with Other Security Features

Security headers work alongside:

1. **CORS** (`CORS_CONFIGURATION.md`) - Controls origin access
2. **Rate Limiting** (`RATE_LIMITING.md`) - Prevents abuse
3. **Input Validation** (`INPUT_VALIDATION.md`) - Sanitizes input
4. **Request Size Limiting** - Prevents memory exhaustion

Together, these provide defense-in-depth security.

## Monitoring

Watch for CSP violations in production:

```javascript
// Add CSP violation reporting (future enhancement)
contentSecurityPolicy: {
  directives: {
    // ... existing directives
    reportUri: '/api/csp-violation',
  },
}
```

Then create an endpoint to log violations:

```javascript
app.post('/api/csp-violation', express.json(), (req, res) => {
  console.warn('CSP Violation:', req.body);
  res.status(204).end();
});
```

## Performance Impact

Helmet has minimal performance impact:

- Headers add ~1-2 KB to response
- No runtime processing overhead
- One-time header generation per response
- **Recommendation:** Always use in production

## Best Practices

### ✅ DO

- Use Helmet in all environments
- Enable HSTS in production only
- Configure CSP based on actual resource needs
- Test headers after deployment
- Monitor CSP violations in production
- Update Helmet regularly for new security features

### ❌ DON'T

- Don't disable Helmet to "fix" issues - fix the underlying problem
- Don't use `'unsafe-eval'` in CSP unless absolutely necessary
- Don't disable X-Frame-Options unless you need iframe embedding
- Don't use `frameguard: false` - use specific allow-from instead
- Don't forget to test on all browsers
