# Field Exit Protocol 4 — Designing a Clean Exit

## Purpose

To complete a field in a structured, deliberate way so that every part—emotional, relational, and
practical—is brought to closure. Designing a clean exit means leaving no loose ends that drain
attention or energy. It ensures that transitions are handled with clarity, that relationships end
respectfully, and that systems are left in good order. A clean exit turns completion into a
conscious act of stewardship rather than avoidance or haste.

## Why This Matters

The way you leave determines the quality of what comes next. Messy exits create confusion, lingering
emotion, and reputational noise. Clean exits preserve integrity and signal to yourself and others
that you close what you start. This practice reflects Stewardship, Not Ownership—you leave things
better than you found them—and Integrity Is the Growth Strategy, ensuring continuity between past
work and future potential.

## Use This When

- You're preparing to leave a project, role, or relationship.
- You want to make sure every detail—emotional or logistical—is complete.
- You sense unfinished business but aren't sure where it sits.
- You've exited before but noticed lingering complications afterward.
- You want the next beginning to start clean, not as a continuation of the old field.

## Outcomes

- **Poor:** We leave without proper closure. Emotional and practical residue follow, pulling
  attention back to what's finished.
- **Expected:** We close some parts but overlook others. The next field begins with mixed clarity
  and leftover obligations.
- **Excellent:** We complete fully—people, tasks, and systems are left in order. The transition
  feels light and confident.
- **Transcendent:** We develop a habit of clean closure. Endings and beginnings become seamless,
  with energy flowing freely between them.

## Themes

### 1. Tying Loose Threads _(Stone 8: Integrity Is the Growth Strategy)_

**Purpose:** To identify and complete any open relationships, tasks, or commitments that need
attention before closure. This includes conversations, documents, responsibilities, or follow-ups
that remain unaddressed. **Why this matters:** Loose threads hold energy. Completing them prevents
leakage of attention or confusion later. It reinforces reliability and strengthens trust across the
field. **Outcomes:**

- Poor: We ignore what's undone. It resurfaces later as frustration or tension.
- Expected: We close a few items but leave minor gaps that complicate the future.
- Excellent: We address every open loop clearly. Energy stabilises and the field rests.
- Transcendent: Completion becomes a personal standard. Every cycle ends with order and readiness
  for the next. **Guiding Questions:**
- What tasks or promises still need completion?
- Who is waiting for a response or action from me?
- What feels unfinished even if it looks minor?

**Completion Prompt:** I've tied every loose thread and left this field in order.

### 2. Clarifying Emotional Closure _(Stone 7: Built for Wholeness)_

**Purpose:** To make sure emotional communication is complete—nothing unsaid that should be said, no
withheld appreciation, no lingering resentment. This step allows the emotional field to match the
practical one in closure. **Why this matters:** Unspoken emotion keeps relationships tethered.
Clarifying emotion allows everyone involved to move on cleanly, protecting future collaboration or
peace of mind. **Outcomes:**

- Poor: We leave emotionally unsettled. The same tension returns later in new contexts.
- Expected: We acknowledge some feelings but leave others hidden. Relief comes slowly.
- Excellent: We express what needs to be said respectfully and completely. Closure feels real.
- Transcendent: We approach all endings with emotional transparency. Relationships remain intact,
  even when roles end. **Guiding Questions:**
- Is there something I still need to say to this person or group?
- Have I expressed appreciation as clearly as feedback?
- What emotional truth remains unspoken?

**Completion Prompt:** I've expressed what was needed emotionally and feel clear in all directions.

### 3. Reviewing Practical Details _(Stone 5: Presence Is Productivity)_

**Purpose:** To ensure that all logistical, financial, and administrative details are handled before
stepping away. This includes documentation, payments, assets, and responsibilities. **Why this
matters:** Practical details are often overlooked during transitions. Overlooking them creates
unnecessary complications for those who continue the work. Handling them cleanly is part of
professional and energetic closure. **Outcomes:**

- Poor: We rush the exit and forget key items. Others must clean up what we left undone.
- Expected: We complete most of the tasks but miss some small details that delay closure.
- Excellent: All paperwork, agreements, and assets are finalised. No one needs to chase follow-ups.
- Transcendent: We become known for finishing cleanly. Our exits set a standard for clarity and
  professionalism. **Guiding Questions:**
- What financial, legal, or administrative items still need action?
- What information must be documented or handed over?
- If someone stepped in tomorrow, would they find everything clear?

**Completion Prompt:** I've reviewed and completed all practical details. Nothing is left for others
to resolve.

### 4. Communicating the Exit _(Stone 9: The Speed of Trust)_

**Purpose:** To make sure your departure or closure is communicated clearly, at the right time, to
the right people. This avoids confusion, rumours, or emotional ripple effects. **Why this matters:**
Communication defines perception. When you leave without clarity, others fill the gaps with stories.
Being direct and thoughtful maintains respect and coherence in the wider system. **Outcomes:**

- Poor: We disappear without proper notice. Trust erodes and confusion spreads.
- Expected: We inform some people but not all. The message spreads unevenly and causes mild
  friction.
- Excellent: We communicate openly and clearly, explaining the transition with respect. The field
  settles quickly.
- Transcendent: Our communication style itself becomes trusted. Others feel guided, not disrupted,
  by our exit. **Guiding Questions:**
- Who needs to know, and in what order?
- What tone best communicates respect and closure?
- How can I share information clearly and calmly?

**Completion Prompt:** I've communicated my exit clearly to all who needed to know.

### 5. Conducting the Handover _(Stone 10: Stewardship, Not Ownership)_

**Purpose:** To transfer responsibility, knowledge, or systems in a way that ensures continuity. The
goal is to set up whoever follows—or the next phase—for success. **Why this matters:** Poor
handovers cause confusion and break trust. Clean handovers maintain momentum and demonstrate
stewardship. They also reinforce the principle that endings serve the wider field, not just the
individual. **Outcomes:**

- Poor: We walk away abruptly. Others struggle to piece things together.
- Expected: We hand over partially, leaving gaps that cause short-term disruption.
- Excellent: We transfer all key knowledge and materials smoothly. The transition is clear and
  uninterrupted.
- Transcendent: We hand over with clarity and grace. The system feels supported, not abandoned.
  **Guiding Questions:**
- Who will continue the work or take responsibility next?
- What do they need to know to succeed?
- Have I explained or documented everything clearly?

**Completion Prompt:** I've handed over everything needed for the next stage to continue smoothly.

### 6. Final Reflection and Release _(Stone 1: Light Before Form)_

**Purpose:** To take one last look at the whole field—what worked, what didn't, what you're taking
with you—and consciously release any remaining attachment. This is the final internal step before
stepping into the new field. **Why this matters:** Even when everything looks complete, energy can
remain attached. Reflection ensures full closure and prevents subtle carryover of tension or
identity. **Outcomes:**

- Poor: We rush out and immediately engage elsewhere. The old field still occupies space internally.
- Expected: We reflect briefly but hold some emotional residue. Focus shifts slowly.
- Excellent: We acknowledge the full picture and release attachment. Energy feels grounded and
  complete.
- Transcendent: We close with quiet confidence. Endings and beginnings flow together as one process.
  **Guiding Questions:**
- What am I proud to leave behind?
- What lesson stands out most from this field?
- What signals tell me this exit is complete?

**Completion Prompt:** I've reflected on the full arc of this field and released it completely.
