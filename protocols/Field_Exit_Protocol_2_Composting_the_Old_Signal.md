# Field Exit Protocol 2 — Composting the Old Signal

## Purpose

To turn what's left from a completed field into useful energy. When a project, phase, or
relationship ends, it leaves behind lessons, habits, emotions, and unfinished thoughts. Composting
means breaking those down so they stop taking energy and start giving it back. The goal is to turn
residue into fuel for the next stage—keeping the system alive, clear, and ready to grow again.

## Why This Matters

If you move on without processing what's ended, old material stays active in the background. It
shows up as hesitation, repetition, or emotional weight. Composting clears that space and converts
it into strength. It reflects Stewardship, Not Ownership—you're responsible for closing the loop but
don't have to hold on. It also supports Integrity Is the Growth Strategy by preventing old
distortions from leaking into new work.

## Use This When

- A project or relationship has ended, but parts of it still feel present.
- You're replaying old experiences or what-ifs.
- You're ready to move forward but feel emotionally or mentally full.
- You want to make sure past effort becomes learning, not baggage.
- You're preparing for a clean start.

## Outcomes

- **Poor:** We try to ignore what's left behind. The same frustrations reappear in new settings,
  slowing progress.
- **Expected:** We talk about what happened and start to understand it. Some energy clears, but
  tension still lingers.
- **Excellent:** We process the residue fully and see how it can strengthen what comes next. New
  work feels lighter and more focused.
- **Transcendent:** We treat every ending as a normal part of growth. Lessons and energy recycle
  naturally, with no waste or emotional buildup.

## Themes

### 1. Naming What Must Break Down _(Stone 4: Clarity Over Cleverness)_

**Purpose:** To clearly identify which parts of the past need to decompose—roles, habits, beliefs, or attachments that no longer work. Naming them is how you take them out of the background and start the composting process.
**Why this matters:** If you don't name what needs to break down, it stays active and keeps influencing decisions. Naming brings clarity and stops hidden drag.
**Outcomes:**

- Poor: We avoid looking at what's expired, and it keeps shaping our behaviour.
- Expected: We name a few pieces but leave others vague, so progress is uneven.
- Excellent: We state clearly what can't continue and why. Energy starts to return.
- Transcendent: We see breakdown as healthy. Endings become easier to handle in the future.

**Guiding Questions:**

- What am I still carrying that doesn't belong in the next phase?
- What habits or attachments have run their course?
- What's ready to be dismantled or released?

**Completion Prompt:** I've identified what needs to break down so energy can move again.

### 2. Allowing the Breakdown _(Stone 6: Nothing Forced, Nothing Withheld)_

**Purpose:** To stop trying to manage or rush the process once you've named what's ending. Composting works best when you give it time. This theme is about letting the breakdown happen without overthinking or forcing progress.
**Why this matters:** Trying to stay in control keeps you tied to the old system. Allowing natural breakdown frees attention for what matters next.
**Outcomes:**

- Poor: We keep checking or adjusting what's ending, and nothing truly releases.
- Expected: We step back a little but still hold emotional tension.
- Excellent: We let go and trust that time and space will do the work.
- Transcendent: We stop resisting endings. Future transitions feel smoother and less personal.

**Guiding Questions:**

- Where am I still holding on?
- What's hard about giving this process time?
- What would change if I stopped managing it?

**Completion Prompt:** I've stepped back and allowed the breakdown to happen in its own time.

### 3. Extracting the Nutrients _(Stone 8: Integrity Is the Growth Strategy)_

**Purpose:** To identify what's useful and worth keeping from the experience that's ended. This could be skills, insights, or lessons. Composting isn't about discarding everything—it's about keeping the good material.
**Why this matters:** Without this step, you lose the learning and risk repeating the same patterns. It also helps you see that even difficult experiences can have value.
**Outcomes:**

- Poor: We move on without reflecting, so mistakes repeat.
- Expected: We notice a few lessons but don't apply them.
- Excellent: We gather clear takeaways and use them to shape better systems or habits.
- Transcendent: Every experience becomes a source of learning. Nothing is wasted.

**Guiding Questions:**

- What worked that I want to repeat?
- What insight came from what didn't work?
- How can this learning be built into how I work now?

**Completion Prompt:** I've collected the useful lessons and understand how to apply them going
forward.

### 4. Releasing the Toxins _(Stone 7: Built for Wholeness)_

**Purpose:** To let go of the negative residue—resentment, guilt, frustration, or self-blame—that can't be turned into learning. These are the parts that need to leave the system completely.
**Why this matters:** If toxins stay, they colour your next field. Releasing them clears the space so new energy can move in cleanly.
**Outcomes:**

- Poor: We hold onto resentment or guilt, and the next project carries the same tone.
- Expected: We acknowledge emotion but stay attached to it.
- Excellent: We release the feelings through expression, forgiveness, or closure.
- Transcendent: We learn to let go easily. Emotional cycles end quickly and leave no trace.

**Guiding Questions:**

- What emotions am I still holding from the old field?
- What do I need to forgive or accept?
- How can I clear this without re-engaging the story?

**Completion Prompt:** I've released what can't be reused and cleared the emotional residue.

### 5. Integrating the Wisdom _(Stone 5: Presence Is Productivity)_

**Purpose:** To make the lessons from the old field part of how you think and act now. Integration means applying insight to behaviour, not just understanding it mentally.
**Why this matters:** Learning only matters when it changes how you move. Integration turns reflection into better practice.
**Outcomes:**

- Poor: We understand the lesson but act the same.
- Expected: We apply part of the insight but slip into old habits.
- Excellent: We use what we learned consistently, improving outcomes.
- Transcendent: Wisdom becomes natural. The new patterns replace the old without effort.

**Guiding Questions:**

- How will I use what I've learned in real situations?
- What behaviour shows this lesson has landed?
- Where do I still act as if I haven't learned it?

**Completion Prompt:** I've integrated what I've learned and turned it into a repeatable way of
working.

### 6. Preparing the New Soil _(Stone 1: Light Before Form)_

**Purpose:** To make sure you're ready for the next field by stabilising your energy and creating clear ground for new work. This theme is about pausing before you start again.
**Why this matters:** If you rush into the next project too fast, you carry old residue forward. Taking time to rest and reset ensures the new field starts clean.
**Outcomes:**

- Poor: We rush ahead, repeating the same mistakes.
- Expected: We rest briefly, but the old mindset reappears under pressure.
- Excellent: We pause fully, restore balance, and restart with focus.
- Transcendent: Renewal becomes part of the process; every ending naturally feeds the next
  beginning.

**Guiding Questions:**

- How can I tell my system is ready for something new?
- What would real rest look like right now?
- What small signs show new energy is beginning to form?

**Completion Prompt:** I've created the conditions for the next phase and can start fresh without
carrying the past.

---

## Completion Prompts

- I have named what needs to decompose and allowed the process to begin.
- I recognize that endings leave behind both nutrients and toxins.
- I trust that time and space will complete what conscious effort cannot force.
- I honor the lessons without carrying the weight of the past.
- I carry forward only what serves the new field, leaving the rest to compost naturally.
