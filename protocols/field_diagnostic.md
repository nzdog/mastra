# Field Diagnostic Protocol

## Purpose
To surface the invisible field currently shaping the user's behavior, decisions, and emotional stance. This protocol helps them locate themselves within the surrounding environment of norms, incentives, and pressures—so they can see clearly what is holding them, rather than mistaking it for personal failure or strength.

## What Is a Field?
A field is the invisible architecture of forces that shapes what feels normal, possible, or rewarded in a given context. Fields act like gravity—they train your behavior, pace, and decisions, often without you noticing.

Fields aren't personal. They're systemic. You might think you're failing when really, you're just inside a field that makes certain things feel impossible.

## Examples of Common Fields
- **The Hustle Field**: Late nights are normal, speed trumps depth, rest feels like failure
- **The Urgency Field**: Everything must happen now, quick answers over clarity, shortcuts compound
- **The Burnout Field**: Always behind, firefighting rewarded, heroic saves expected
- **The Proving Field**: Daily validation required, worth tied to output, never enough
- **The Coherence Field**: Rhythm balances intensity and rest, trust compounds, clarity valued

## Why This Matters
Fields are powerful—they act like gravity. They set what feels possible, what is rewarded, and what is ignored. Without diagnosis, users may misinterpret systemic pressure as a personal flaw, or mistake collapse for clarity.

**The key insight: It's not you, it's the field.**

You might think "I'm not disciplined enough" when actually you're in a field where rest is punished. Or think "I can't keep up" when you're in a field organized around unsustainable pace.

By naming the field, they reclaim the ability to choose how to respond and whether to remain inside it. You can't exit what you can't see.

## Use This When
- Feeling stuck, stalled, or conflicted.
- Wanting to clarify whether actions are aligned with coherence or driven by collapse.
- Preparing for a Field Exit or Field Shift.

## Outcomes
- **Poor:** Continue without awareness, leading to a future of repeating patterns unconsciously.
- **Expected:** Identify the field they are currently in, building a future of clearer self-understanding and reduced self-blame.
- **Excellent:** See how the field trains behaviors, opening a future of anticipation and resistance.
- **Transcendent:** Embody field awareness so fully that they can shift fields at will, shaping a future where coherence is the natural habitat.

## Themes

### 1. Surface Behaviors *(Stone 4: Clarity Over Cleverness)*
**Purpose:** Name visible habits, choices, and language patterns that hint at the underlying field.
**Why this matters:** Behavior is the first clue; without surfacing patterns, fields remain hidden.
**Outcomes:**
- Poor: Deny or ignore behaviors → future of unchecked repetition.
- Expected: Name surface behaviors → future of more accurate reflection.
- Excellent: Connect behaviors to field dynamics → future of proactive awareness.
- Transcendent: Behaviors become live signals → future of instant self-correction.
**Guiding Questions:**
- What language am I using most often right now?
- How do I act under pressure—push harder, freeze, comply, withdraw?
- What behaviors would others notice first in me this week?

**Completion Prompt:**
I have named the visible patterns in my behavior and language without judgment.

### 2. Felt Experience *(Stone 5: Presence Is Productivity)*
**Purpose:** Attend to how the body and emotions register the field.
**Why this matters:** Fields show up in the nervous system before logic.
**Outcomes:**
- Poor: Override signals → future of burnout or collapse.
- Expected: Notice cues → future of informed choices.
- Excellent: Map experience to field dynamics → future of deeper alignment.
- Transcendent: Body becomes compass → future of embodied diagnosis.
**Guiding Questions:**
- What sensations arise when I picture continuing as I am?
- Where does tension, heaviness, or lightness sit in my body?
- What emotions repeat most often this week?

**Completion Prompt:**
I have noticed how my body registers this field, and I trust these signals.

### 3. Rewards and Punishments *(Stone 8: Integrity Is the Growth Strategy)*
**Purpose:** Identify what the field rewards and punishes.
**Why this matters:** Incentives train behavior; naming them breaks control.
**Outcomes:**
- Poor: Misinterpret incentives as preferences → future of manipulation.
- Expected: See rewards/punishments → future of clearer agency.
- Excellent: Identify incentive shaping → future of resistance.
- Transcendent: Operate by integrity → future of freedom from manipulation.
**Guiding Questions:**
- What gets praised, noticed, or rewarded in this context?
- What is ignored, punished, or made invisible?
- When do I feel compelled to comply even if misaligned?

**Completion Prompt:**
I have identified what this field rewards and punishes, and I see how it trains behavior.

### 4. Source Stories *(Stone 1: Light Before Form)*
**Purpose:** Uncover narratives and myths the field is built on.
**Why this matters:** Stories carry fields; until named, they remain unquestioned.
**Outcomes:**
- Poor: Accept stories as fact → future of conformity.
- Expected: Identify dominant stories → future of critical distance.
- Excellent: See how stories shape choices → future of discernment.
- Transcendent: Rewrite the story → future of self-authored field.
**Guiding Questions:**
- What story does this field tell about success and failure?
- What story does it tell about rest, productivity, or worth?
- What story does it tell about relationships and power?

**Completion Prompt:**
I have named the stories this field tells, and I recognize they are not inevitable truths.

### 5. Pressure Points *(Stone 6: Nothing Forced, Nothing Withheld)*
**Purpose:** Examine how the field behaves under stress.
**Why this matters:** Stress exposes the underlying logic of a field.
**Outcomes:**
- Poor: Internalize stress logic → future of repeated collapse.
- Expected: Notice stress behaviors → future of awareness.
- Excellent: See how demands train responses → future of choice.
- Transcendent: Remain steady regardless of field pressure → future of resilient coherence.
**Guiding Questions:**
- How does this field react when things go wrong?
- What is demanded under stress?
- How do I find myself reacting in parallel?

**Completion Prompt:**
I have seen how this field behaves under stress, and I notice how I respond in parallel.

### 6. Naming the Field *(Stone 2: The Speed of Trust)*
**Purpose:** Gather evidence and explicitly name the field.
**Why this matters:** Naming breaks spellwork; invisibility ends, choice returns.
**Outcomes:**
- Poor: Avoid naming → future of vague unease and repetition.
- Expected: Name the field directly → future of orientation.
- Excellent: See how the field shaped choices → future of active resistance.
- Transcendent: Name with clarity → future where perception itself grows trust.
**Guiding Questions:**
- Based on all evidence, what field am I in?
- Does this field align with coherence, or collapse?
- What shifts if I trust this naming?

**Completion Prompt:**
I have named the field I am in and trust this perception, even if others cannot see it.

## Completion Prompts
- I have named the field I am in without judgment.
- I recognize that this field has been training my behavior, and I can now choose differently.
- I trust my perception of the field, even if others cannot see it.
- I honor the stories, pressures, and rewards of this field without letting them define me.
- I carry forward clarity about where I stand, so my next step can be chosen in coherence.
